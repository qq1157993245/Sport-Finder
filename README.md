> ⚠️ **Note**  
> You may see a small **down arrow icon** near the bottom right, next to the "Profile" tab.  
> This is **not part of the app** — it's part of **Expo Go’s preview interface**.  
> If you accidentally tap it, simply close the app and Expo, then **reopen it by scanning the QR code again**.
